# Pintor - Write Ahead Log Implementation

Pintor is a robust, thread-safe Java implementation of a Write Ahead Log (WAL) system for ensuring data durability and consistency in databases. The name "pintor" means "painter" in Spanish - a playful nod to "painting" walls (WALs) with persistent data.

## Key Features

- üîí **Thread-safe operations**: Atomic entry creation and batching, eliminating race conditions.
- üìÅ **File-based persistence**: Automatic rotation, binary serialization with CRC32 for integrity.
- üîÑ **Recovery capabilities**: Point-in-time recovery by sequence or timestamp; persists across restarts.
- ‚ö° **Performance optimizations**: Batch APIs, configurable sync, efficient seeking and truncation.
- üß© **Flexible design**: Generic record types, clean encapsulation.
- ü§ñ **AI-assisted development**: Generated codebase for production readiness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Gradle for building and testing

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukaszbudnik/pintor.git
cd pintor
```

Build and test:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Usage

### Basic Entry Creation

```java
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    ByteBuffer data = ByteBuffer.wrap("INSERT|txn_1001|users|1|{\"name\":\"John\"}".getBytes());
    WALEntry entry = wal.createAndAppend(data);
}
```

### Large Entry Handling

Pintor seamlessly handles entries of any size, automatically spanning them across multiple pages when needed:

```java
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    // Large entry that will span multiple pages
    String largeData = "x".repeat(10000); // 10KB entry
    ByteBuffer data = ByteBuffer.wrap(largeData.getBytes());
    WALEntry entry = wal.createAndAppend(data); // Automatically handles spanning
}
```

### Batch Operations

```java
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    List<ByteBuffer> batch = Arrays.asList(
        ByteBuffer.wrap("BEGIN|txn_2001|".getBytes()),
        ByteBuffer.wrap("INSERT|txn_2001|products|1|{\"name\":\"Laptop\"}".getBytes()),
        ByteBuffer.wrap("COMMIT|txn_2001|".getBytes())
    );
    wal.createAndAppendBatch(batch);
}
```
### Reading

```java
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    // Read from sequence
    List<WALEntry> entries = wal.readFrom(0L);
    
    // Read sequence range
    List<WALEntry> rangeEntries = wal.readRange(5L, 10L);
    
    // Point-in-time recovery
    Instant recoveryPoint = Instant.parse("2025-08-28T10:30:00Z");
    List<WALEntry> timeEntries = wal.readFrom(recoveryPoint);
    
    // Read timestamp range
    Instant startTime = Instant.parse("2025-08-28T10:00:00Z");
    Instant endTime = Instant.parse("2025-08-28T11:00:00Z");
    List<WALEntry> timeRangeEntries = wal.readRange(startTime, endTime);
}
```

### Recovery

The WAL automatically recovers the last sequence number and entry count when reopened:

```java
// First session
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(walDir)) {
    WALEntry entry = wal.createAndAppend(ByteBuffer.wrap("data".getBytes()));
    // Application crashes here
}

// Second session - automatic recovery
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(walDir)) {
    // Automatically recovers last sequence number
    long lastSeq = wal.getCurrentSequenceNumber();
    // Continue operations with proper sequence number continuation
    WALEntry newEntry = wal.createAndAppend(ByteBuffer.wrap("recovered_data".getBytes()));
    System.out.println("New entry sequence: " + newEntry.getSequenceNumber()); // Will be lastSeq + 1
}
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **WALPageHeader**: POJO for the page header with sequence/timestamp ranges, entry count, and CRC32. Enables O(1) recovery and efficient range queries.
- **WALEntry**: POJO for the actual log entry. Immutable data record containing sequence number, timestamp, and user data (ByteBuffer).
- **WriteAheadLog**: Interface for WAL contracts.
- **FileBasedWAL**: File-based implementation with rotation and CRC32. Thread-safe high-level API providing entry creation, batch operations, reading, and recovery.

### Storage Format

#### WAL Log Files: `wal-{index}.log`

A WAL file, such as `wal-0.log`, is a collection of fixed-size 4KB pages. The file grows as new data is written, and a new file is created (rotated) when the size limit is reached (default: 64MB).

```
+----------------------+
|      wal-0.log       |
+----------------------+
|   WAL Page 1 (4KB)   |
+----------------------+
|   WAL Page 2 (4KB)   |
+----------------------+
|         ...          |
+----------------------+
|   WAL Page N (4KB)   |
+----------------------+
```

#### Page Structure

Each page consists of a fixed-size header and a data section that contains the WAL entries.

```
+------------------------------------------------+
|          WAL Page (4096 bytes)                 |
+------------------------------------------------+
|  +------------------------------------------+  |
|  |           Page Header (44 bytes)         |  |
|  +------------------------------------------+  |
|  |  Magic Number (4B)                       |  |
|  |  First Sequence (8B)                     |  |
|  |  Last Sequence (8B)                      |  |
|  |  First Timestamp (8B)                    |  |
|  |  Last Timestamp (8B)                     |  |
|  |  Entry Count (2B)                        |  |
|  |  Continuation Flags (2B)                 |  |
|  |  Header CRC32 (4B)                       |  |
|  +------------------------------------------+  |
|  |           Data Section (4052 bytes)      |  |
|  +------------------------------------------+  |
|  |  WAL Entry 1 (Variable Length)           |  |
|  |  WAL Entry 2 (Variable Length)           |  |
|  |  ...                                     |  |
|  |  Free Space                              |  |
|  +------------------------------------------+  |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

- **Page Header Fields (44 bytes)**:
  - Magic Number (4B) - `0xDEADBEEF` for validation
  - First Sequence (8B) - Lowest sequence number in page
  - Last Sequence (8B) - Highest sequence number in page
  - First Timestamp (8B) - Earliest entry timestamp milliseconds in page
  - Last Timestamp (8B) - Latest entry timestamp milliseconds in page
  - Entry Count (2B) - Number of entries in page
  - Continuation Flags (2B) - FIRST_PART=1, MIDDLE_PART=2, LAST_PART=4
  - Header CRC32 (4B) - Validates header integrity
- **Data Section (4052 bytes)** - Contains WAL entries or continuation data for entries spanning multiple pages (for more see: [Record Spanning Examples](#record-spanning-examples))
- **Free Space** - Unused bytes at page end, occurs when:
  - Page is flushed before completely full by either manual sync or read operations (for more see: [Page Flushing to Disk](#page-flushing-to-disk))
  - Next entry is too large to fit in remaining space

#### WAL Entry Structure

Entries are stored sequentially in the data section of a page. An entry is composed of a fixed-size header and a variable-length data payload.

- Entry Type (1B) - DATA=1, CHECKPOINT=2
- Sequence Number (8B)
- Timestamp Milliseconds (8B)
- Data Length (4B)
- Data (variable)
- CRC32 (4B)

```
+------------------------------------------------+
|           WAL Entry (Variable Length)          |
+------------------------------------------------+
|  Entry Type (1B)     |  Sequence Number (8B)   |
+------------------------------------------------+
|  Timestamp (8B)      |  Data Length (4B)       |
+------------------------------------------------+
|             Data (Variable Length)             |
+------------------------------------------------+
|                   CRC32 (4B)                   |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

### Page Flushing to Disk

Pages and WAL entries are buffered in memory and written to disk when any of the following conditions occur:

1. Page becomes full - When the current page reaches 4KB capacity
2. Manual sync - When sync() method is called explicitly for durability
3. Reading from log - When any of the read*() methods are called to make sure all data is on disk
4. WAL closure - When close() method is called to ensure all data is persisted

### Record Spanning Examples

**Page Structure**: Each page is 4096 bytes with a 44-byte header, leaving 4052 bytes for data. Each entry has 25-byte header and a variable length data.

**Multiple Small Entries (fit in one page):**

```
Page 1 (4096 bytes): [Header: 44 bytes, flags=0, seq=101-103]
  Entry 101: 175 bytes (25 byte header + 150 byte data)
  Entry 102: 175 bytes (25 byte header + 150 byte data)
  Entry 103: 175 bytes (25 byte header + 150 byte data)
  Total used: 44 + 525 = 569 bytes, Free space: 3,527 bytes
```

**Large Entry Spanning with Mixed Content (10KB entry):**

```
Entry 203: 10,225 byte data

Page 1 (4096 bytes): [Header: 44 bytes, flags=FIRST_PART, seq=200-203]
  Entry 200: 175 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 201: 175 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 202: 175 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 203: 3,527 bytes (25 byte header + 3,502 bytes of data)
  Total used: 44 + 525 + 3,527 = 4,096 bytes, Free space: 0 bytes

Entry 203 remaining bytes to write: 6,723 bytes

Page 2 (4096 bytes): [Header: 44 bytes, flags=MIDDLE_PART, seq=203-203]
  Entry 203 continuation: 4,052 bytes (25 byte header + 4,027 bytes of data)
  Total used: 44 + 4,052 = 4,096 bytes, Free space: 0 bytes

Remaining entry 203 to write: 2,696 bytes

Page 3 (4096 bytes): [Header: 44 bytes, flags=LAST_PART, seq=203-207]
  Entry 203 final data: 2,721 bytes (25 byte header + 2,696 bytes of data)
  Entry 204: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 205: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 206: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 207: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Total used: 44 + 2,721 + 800 = 3,565, Free space: 531 bytes
```

**Entry Spanning Single Page (FIRST_PART | LAST_PART):**

```
Entry 304: 4,096 byte data
Entry 305: 3,456 byte data

Page 1 (4096 bytes): [Header: 44 bytes, flags=FIRST_PART, seq=300-304]
  Entry 300: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 301: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 302: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 303: 200 bytes (complete entry)
  Entry 304: 3,252 bytes (FIRST_PART, 25 byte header + 3,227 bytes of data)
  Total used: 44 + 800 + 3,252 = 4,096, Free space: 0 bytes

Entry 304 remaining bytes to write: 869 bytes

Page 2 (4096 bytes): [Header: 44 bytes, flags=FIRST_PART | LAST_PART, seq=304-305]
  Entry 304: 894 bytes (LAST_PART, 25 byte header + 869 bytes of data)
  Entry 305: 3,158 bytes (FIRST_PART, 25 byte header + 3,133 bytes of data)
  Total used: 44 + 894 + 3,158 = 4,096, Free space: 0 bytes

Entry 305 remaining bytes to write: 323 bytes

Page 3 (4096 bytes): [Header: 44 bytes, flags=LAST_PART, seq=305-305]
  Entry 305: 348 bytes (LAST_PART, 25 byte header + 323)
  Total used: 44 + 348 = 392, Free space: 3,705 bytes
```

**Key Rules:**
- Every page always has a 44-byte header
- Every entry always has a 25-byte header
- Continuation flags indicate spanning record parts: FIRST_PART=1, MIDDLE_PART=2, LAST_PART=4
- Multiple complete entries can coexist with spanning entry parts in the same page
- When FIRST_PART flag is set with multiple entries, only the last entry in sequence range is spanning
- When LAST_PART flag is set with multiple entries, only the first entry in sequence range is spanning
- FIRST_PART | LAST_PART combination indicates both spanning parts exist in the same page
- First/Last sequence in header reflects all entry sequences present in that page
- **Spanning entries are always written to the same WAL file** - a logical entry is never split across multiple WAL files
- **WAL files can exceed the configured `maxFileSize`** to accommodate complete spanning entries. Entry atomicity takes precedence over file size limits. This ensures data consistency and simplifies recovery logic at the cost of potentially larger files.

### Recovery Process:
1. Seek to last page boundary in newest file
2. Read 44-byte page header from the last page
3. Extract sequence and timestamp metadata instantly from header
4. Check continuation flags to understand page content type
5. Total recovery time: O(1) regardless of file size

### Reading from sequence number range or timestamp range

1. Scan all WAL files: Read the first and last page headers from each WAL file
2. Filter overlapping files: Build a list of WAL files whose sequence/timestamp ranges overlap with the requested range
3. Process overlapping files: For each overlapping WAL file, read all pages
4. Skip non-overlapping pages: Within each file, skip pages whose ranges don't overlap with the requested range
5. Filter and return entries: From overlapping pages, return only WAL entries that fall within the requested range

## API Summary

Pintor is lightweight with minimal external dependencies, relying only on:
- [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) for streaming large amounts of data efficiently. All read operations return reactive `Publisher<WALEntry>`  that enable backpressure handling and prevent memory exhaustion when processing large datasets.
- [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) for structured logging and diagnostics.

### WriteAheadLog

- `WALEntry createAndAppend(ByteBuffer data)`: Create single entry from ByteBuffer.
- `List<WALEntry> createAndAppendBatch(List<ByteBuffer> dataList)`: Batch create from ByteBuffers.
- `Publisher<WALEntry> readFrom(long fromSequenceNumber)`: Read entries from sequence number.
- `Publisher<WALEntry> readFrom(Instant fromTimestamp)`: Read entries from timestamp.
- `Publisher<WALEntry> readRange(long fromSequenceNumber, long toSequenceNumber)`: Read entries in sequence range.
- `Publisher<WALEntry> readRange(Instant fromTimestamp, Instant toTimestamp)`: Read entries in timestamp range.
- `void sync()`: Force sync to disk.
- `void truncate(long upToSequenceNumber)`: Truncate log up to sequence.
- `long getCurrentSequenceNumber()`: Get last sequence number.
- `long getNextSequenceNumber()`: Get next available sequence.
- `long size()`: Get entry count.
- `boolean isEmpty()`: Check if WAL is empty.

### WALMetrics

WALMetrics provides comprehensive operational statistics for monitoring and performance analysis:

```java
WALMetrics metrics = wal.getMetrics();

// Write metrics
long entriesWritten = metrics.getEntriesWritten();
long bytesWritten = metrics.getBytesWritten();
long pagesWritten = metrics.getPagesWritten();
long filesCreated = metrics.getFilesCreated();

// Read metrics
long entriesRead = metrics.getEntriesRead();
long pagesRead = metrics.getPagesRead();
long rangeQueries = metrics.getRangeQueries();

// I/O efficiency metrics
long filesScanned = metrics.getFilesScanned();
long pagesScanned = metrics.getPagesScanned();
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **Write Operations**: Track entries written, total bytes, pages written, and file creation
- **Read Operations**: Monitor entries read, pages read, and query patterns
- **I/O Efficiency**: Measure files and pages scanned for performance optimization
- **Thread-Safe**: All counters use atomic operations for concurrent access
- **Cumulative**: Metrics accumulate across the lifetime of the WAL instance

### Configuration

```java
// Custom configuration
WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(
    walDirectory,
    64 * 1024 * 1024  // max file size (default: 64MB)
);

// Or use default settings
WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(walDirectory);
```

### Flexible Data Handling

Pintor's data entries are intentionally designed to use `ByteBuffer` to maximize flexibility. This allows developers to send any data structure - such as JSON, serialized objects, or custom binary formats - without being constrained by a rigid schema. For example, you can include custom fields like transaction IDs, operation types, or metadata in the payload. These fields can later be used for custom filtering during reads or recovery, enabling application-specific logic like transaction tracking or selective replay.

#### Example: JSON with ByteBuffer
```java
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    ByteBuffer jsonData = ByteBuffer.wrap("{\"txnId\":\"txn_4001\",\"operation\":\"INSERT\"}".getBytes());
    WALEntry entry = wal.createAndAppend(jsonData);
}
```

#### Example: Structured Data with ByteBuffer
```java
try (WriteAheadLog wal = new FileBasedWAL(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(128)
        .putInt(4001) // Transaction ID
        .put("INSERT".getBytes());
    buffer.flip();
    WALEntry entry = wal.createAndAppend(buffer);
}
```
