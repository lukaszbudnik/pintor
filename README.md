# Pintor - Write Ahead Log Implementation

Pintor is a robust, thread-safe Java implementation of a Write Ahead Log (WAL) system for ensuring data durability and consistency in databases. The name "pintor" means "painter" in Spanish - a playful nod to "painting" walls (WALs) with persistent data.

## Key Features

- üîí **Thread-safe operations**: Atomic entry creation and batching, eliminating race conditions.
- üìÅ **File-based persistence**: Automatic rotation, binary serialization with CRC32 for integrity.
- üîÑ **Recovery capabilities**: Point-in-time recovery by sequence or timestamp; persists across restarts.
- ‚ö° **Performance optimizations**: Batch APIs, configurable sync, efficient seeking and truncation.
- üß© **Flexible design**: Generic record types, clean encapsulation.
- ü§ñ **AI-assisted development**: Generated codebase for production readiness.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Gradle for building and testing

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukaszbudnik/pintor.git
cd pintor
```

Build and test:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Usage

### Basic Entry Creation

```java
try (WALManager walManager = new WALManager(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    byte[] data = "INSERT|txn_1001|users|1|{\"name\":\"John\"}".getBytes();
    WALEntry entry = walManager.createEntry(data);
}
```

### Batch Operations

```java
try (WALManager walManager = new WALManager(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    List<byte[]> batch = Arrays.asList(
        "BEGIN|txn_2001|".getBytes(),
        "INSERT|txn_2001|products|1|{\"name\":\"Laptop\"}".getBytes(),
        "COMMIT|txn_2001|".getBytes()
    );
    walManager.createEntryBatchFromBytes(batch);
}
```
### Reading

```java
try (WALManager walManager = new WALManager(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    // Read from sequence
    List<WALEntry> entries = walManager.readFrom(0L);
    
    // Read sequence range
    List<WALEntry> rangeEntries = walManager.readRange(5L, 10L);
    
    // Point-in-time recovery
    Instant recoveryPoint = Instant.parse("2025-08-28T10:30:00Z");
    List<WALEntry> timeEntries = walManager.readFrom(recoveryPoint);
    
    // Read timestamp range
    Instant startTime = Instant.parse("2025-08-28T10:00:00Z");
    Instant endTime = Instant.parse("2025-08-28T11:00:00Z");
    List<WALEntry> timeRangeEntries = walManager.readRange(startTime, endTime);
}
```

### Recovery

The WAL automatically recovers the last sequence number and entry count when reopened:

```java
// First session
try (WALManager walManager = new WALManager(walDir)) {
    WALEntry entry = walManager.createEntry("data".getBytes());
    // Application crashes here
}

// Second session - automatic recovery
try (WALManager walManager = new WALManager(walDir)) {
    // Automatically recovers last sequence number
    long lastSeq = walManager.getCurrentSequenceNumber();
    // Continue operations with proper sequence number continuation
    WALEntry newEntry = walManager.createEntry("recovered_data".getBytes());
    System.out.println("New entry sequence: " + newEntry.getSequenceNumber()); // Will be lastSeq + 1
}
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **WALPageHeader**: POJO for the page header with sequence/timestamp ranges, entry count, and CRC32. Enables O(1) recovery and efficient range queries.
- **WALEntry**: POJO for the actual log entry. Immutable data record containing sequence number, timestamp, and user data (ByteBuffer).
- **WriteAheadLog**: Interface for WAL contracts.
- **FileBasedWAL**: File-based implementation with rotation and CRC32.
- **WALManager**: Thread-safe high-level API providing entry creation, batch operations, reading, and recovery. Wraps FileBasedWAL with simplified interface and automatic resource management.

### Storage Format

**Page-Based WAL Format**

Pintor uses a page-based storage format similar to PostgreSQL and MySQL for optimal performance and O(1) recovery:

**WAL Log Files: `wal-{index}.log`**

Each file is organized into fixed-size 4KB pages. Automatically rotated when size limit is reached (default: 64MB).
Examples: `wal-0.log`, `wal-1.log`, `wal-2.log`.

**Page Structure (4096 bytes):**

Every page has the same header structure - no exceptions:

- **Page Header (52 bytes)**:
  - Magic Number (4B) - 0xDEADBEEF for validation
  - First Sequence (8B) - Lowest sequence number in page
  - Last Sequence (8B) - Highest sequence number in page  
  - First Timestamp Seconds (8B) - Earliest entry timestamp seconds in page
  - First Timestamp Nanos (4B) - Earliest entry timestamp nanoseconds in page
  - Last Timestamp Seconds (8B) - Latest entry timestamp seconds in page
  - Last Timestamp Nanos (4B) - Latest entry timestamp nanoseconds in page
  - Entry Count (2B) - Number of entries in page
  - Continuation Flags (2B) - FIRST_PART=1, MIDDLE_PART=2, LAST_PART=4
  - Header CRC (4B) - Validates header integrity
- **Data Section (4044 bytes)** - WAL entries or continuation data
- **Free Space** - Unused space at end of page

**WAL Entry Format:**
- Entry Type (1B) - DATA=1, CHECKPOINT=2
- Sequence Number (8B)
- Timestamp Seconds (8B)
- Timestamp Nanoseconds (4B)
- Data Length (4B)
- Data (variable)
- CRC32 (4B)

**Page Flushing to Disk**

Pages and WAL entries are buffered in memory and written to disk when any of the following conditions occur:

1. Page becomes full - When the current page reaches 4KB capacity
2. Manual sync - When sync() method is called explicitly for durability
3. Reading from log - When any of the read*() methods are called to make sure all data is on disk
4. WAL closure - When close() method is called to ensure all data is persisted

**Record Spanning Examples:**

*Multiple Small Entries (fit in one page):*
```
Page 1: [Header: flags=0, entryCount=3][Entry seq=101][Entry seq=102][Entry seq=103][Free space]
```

*Large Entry (spans 3 pages):*

‚ö†Ô∏è Large entry is not yet implemented. Currently, Pintor throws an exception if an entry is too large to fit in a single page.

```
Page 1: [Header: flags=FIRST_PART, seq=100-100][Entry header + 4KB data][No free space]
Page 2: [Header: flags=MIDDLE_PART, seq=100-100][4KB continuation data][No free space]  
Page 3: [Header: flags=LAST_PART, seq=100-100][2KB final data][Free space]
```

*Mixed Page (small entry + large entry start + small entry):*

‚ö†Ô∏è Large entry is not yet implemented. Currently, Pintor throws an exception if an entry is too large to fit in a single page.

```
Page 1: [Header: flags=FIRST_PART, seq=200-201][Entry seq=200 (1KB)][Entry seq=201 header + 3KB data][No free space]
Page 2: [Header: flags=MIDDLE_PART, seq=201-201][4KB continuation data for seq=201][No free space]
Page 3: [Header: flags=LAST_PART, seq=201-202][1KB final data for seq=201][Entry seq=202][Free space]
```

**Key Rules:**
- Every page always has a 52-byte header
- Continuation flags in header indicate spanning record parts
- Spanning records share the same sequence number across all pages
- First/Last sequence in header reflects actual entry sequences in that page
- Middle pages contain only continuation data, no new entry headers

**Recovery Process:**
1. Seek to last page boundary in newest file: `fileSize - (fileSize % 4096)`
2. Read 52-byte page header from the last page
3. Extract sequence and timestamp metadata instantly from header
4. Check continuation flags to understand page content type
5. Total recovery time: O(1) regardless of file size

## **Reading from sequence number range or timestamp range:**

1. Scan all WAL files: Read the first and last page headers from each WAL file
2. Filter overlapping files: Build a list of WAL files whose sequence/timestamp ranges overlap with the requested range
3. Process overlapping files: For each overlapping WAL file, read all pages
4. Skip non-overlapping pages: Within each file, skip pages whose ranges don't overlap with the requested range
5. Filter and return entries: From overlapping pages, return only WAL entries that fall within the requested range

## Flexible Data Handling

Pintor's data entries are intentionally designed to use `ByteBuffer` (or `byte[]`) to maximize flexibility. This allows developers to send any data structure - such as JSON, serialized objects, or custom binary formats - without being constrained by a rigid schema. For example, you can include custom fields like transaction IDs, operation types, or metadata in the payload. These fields can later be used for custom filtering during reads or recovery, enabling application-specific logic like transaction tracking or selective replay.

### Using byte[] and ByteBuffer APIs

Use `byte[]` for simple payloads like JSON or serialized objects, ideal for quick prototyping. Use `ByteBuffer` for structured or high-performance data, enabling precise control over binary formats.

#### Example: JSON with byte[]
```java
try (WALManager walManager = new WALManager(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    byte[] jsonData = "{\"txnId\":\"txn_4001\",\"operation\":\"INSERT\"}".getBytes();
    WALEntry entry = walManager.createEntry(jsonData);
}
```

#### Example: Structured Data with ByteBuffer
```java
try (WALManager walManager = new WALManager(Paths.get("/path/to/wal"))) {
    ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(128)
        .putInt(4001) // Transaction ID
        .put("INSERT".getBytes());
    buffer.flip();
    WALEntry entry = walManager.createEntry(buffer);
}
```
